NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG,CC BY-4.0,GDP (annual % growth),"Gross domestic product is the total income earned through the production of goods and services in an economic territory during an accounting period. It can be measured in three different ways: using either the expenditure approach, the income approach, or the production approach. This indicator denotes the percentage change over each previous year of the constant price (base year 2015) series in United States dollars.","Country official statistics, National Statistical Organizations and/or Central Banks;
National Accounts data files, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD);
Staff estimates, World Bank (WB)",Economic Policy & Debt: National accounts: Growth rates,WB_WDI,%,Annual,1961-2024,Weighted average,"Methodology: National accounts are compiled in accordance with international standards: System of National Accounts, 2008 or 1993 versions. Specific information on how countries compile their national accounts can be found on the IMF website: https://dsbb.imf.org/
Statistical concept(s): The conceptual elements of the SNA (System of National Accounts) measure what takes place in the economy, between which agents, and for what purpose. At the heart of the SNA is the production of goods and services. These may be used for consumption in the period to which the accounts relate or may be accumulated for use in a later period. In simple terms, the amount of value added generated by production represents GDP. The income corresponding to GDP is distributed to the various agents or groups of agents as income and it is the process of distributing and redistributing income that allows one agent to consume the goods and services produced by another agent or to acquire goods and services for later consumption. The way in which the SNA captures this pattern of economic flows is to identify the activities concerned by recognizing the institutional units in the economy and by specifying the structure of accounts capturing the transactions relevant to one stage or another of the process by which goods and services are produced and ultimately consumed.","This indicator is related to the national accounts, which are critical for understanding and managing a country's economy. They provide a framework for the analysis of economic performance. National accounts are the basis for estimating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNI), which are the most widely used indicator of economic performance. They are essential for government policymakers, providing the data needed to design and assess fiscal and monetary policies; and are also used by businesses and investors to assess the economic climate and make investment decisions. NAS enable comparison between economies, which is crucial for international trade, investment decisions, and economic competitiveness. More specifically, this indicator is related to national accounts aggregates. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross National Income (GNI), and other aggregates provide a snapshot of the size and health of an economy by measuring the total economic activity within a country. They can thus be used by policymakers to design and implement economic policies, as they reflect the overall economic performance and can indicate the need for intervention in certain areas. Aggregates also allow for comparisons between different economies, which can be useful for trade negotiations, investment decisions, and economic benchmarking. By examining aggregates over time, economists and analysts can identify trends, cycles, and potential areas of concern within an economy, and investors can use national accounts aggregates to assess the potential risks and returns of investing in a particular country. Overall, national accounts aggregates are fundamental tools for economic analysis, policy formulation, and decision-making at both the national and international levels.","Each industry's contribution to growth in the economy's output is measured by growth in the industry's value added. In principle, value added in constant prices can be estimated by measuring the quantity of goods and services produced in a period, valuing them at an agreed set of base year prices, and subtracting the cost of intermediate inputs, also in constant prices. This double-deflation method requires detailed information on the structure of prices of inputs and outputs.





In many industries, however, value added is extrapolated from the base year using single volume indexes of outputs or, less commonly, inputs. Particularly in the services industries, including most of government, value added in constant prices is often imputed from labor inputs, such as real wages or number of employees. In the absence of well defined measures of output, measuring the growth of services remains difficult.





Moreover, technical progress can lead to improvements in production processes and in the quality of goods and services that, if not properly accounted for, can distort measures of value added and thus of growth. When inputs are used to estimate output, as for nonmarket services, unmeasured technical progress leads to underestimates of the volume of output. Similarly, unmeasured improvements in quality lead to underestimates of the value of output and value added. The result can be underestimates of growth and productivity improvement and overestimates of inflation.





Informal economic activities pose a particular measurement problem, especially in developing countries, where much economic activity is unrecorded. A complete picture of the economy requires estimating household outputs produced for home use, sales in informal markets, barter exchanges, and illicit or deliberately unreported activities. The consistency and completeness of such estimates depend on the skill and methods of the compiling statisticians.





Rebasing of national accounts can alter the measured growth rate of an economy and lead to breaks in series that affect the consistency of data over time. When countries rebase their national accounts, they update the weights assigned to various components to better reflect current patterns of production or uses of output. The new base year should represent normal operation of the economy - it should be a year without major shocks or distortions. Some developing countries have not rebased their national accounts for many years. Using an old base year can be misleading because implicit price and volume weights become progressively less relevant and useful.





To obtain comparable series of constant price data for computing aggregates, the World Bank rescales GDP and value added by industrial origin to a common reference year. Because rescaling changes the implicit weights used in forming regional and income group aggregates, aggregate growth rates are not comparable with those from earlier editions with different base years. Rescaling may result in a discrepancy between the rescaled GDP and the sum of the rescaled components. To avoid distortions in the growth rates, the discrepancy is left unallocated. As a result, the weighted average of the growth rates of the components generally does not equal the GDP growth rate.",,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by
NY.GDP.PCAP.KD.ZG,CC BY-4.0,GDP per capita (annual % growth),"Gross domestic product is the total income earned through the production of goods and services in an economic territory during an accounting period. It can be measured in three different ways: using either the expenditure approach, the income approach, or the production approach. The core indicator has been divided by the general population to achieve a per capita estimate.This indicator denotes the percentage change over each previous year of the constant price (base year 2015) series in United States dollars.","Country official statistics, National Statistical Organizations and/or Central Banks;

Statistical concept(s): The conceptual elements of the SNA (System of National Accounts) measure what takes place in the economy, between which agents, and for what purpose. At the heart of the SNA is the production of goods and services. These may be used for consumption in the period to which the accounts relate or may be accumulated for use in a later period. In simple terms, the amount of value added generated by production represents GDP. The income corresponding to GDP is distributed to the various agents or groups of agents as income and it is the process of distributing and redistributing income that allows one agent to consume the goods and services produced by another agent or to acquire goods and services for later consumption. The way in which the SNA captures this pattern of economic flows is to identify the activities concerned by recognizing the institutional units in the economy and by specifying the structure of accounts capturing the transactions relevant to one stage or another of the process by which goods and services are produced and ultimately consumed.","This indicator is related to the national accounts, which are critical for understanding and managing a country's economy. They provide a framework for the analysis of economic performance. National accounts are the basis for estimating the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Gross National Income (GNI), which are the most widely used indicator of economic performance. They are essential for government policymakers, providing the data needed to design and assess fiscal and monetary policies; and are also used by businesses and investors to assess the economic climate and make investment decisions. NAS enable comparison between economies, which is crucial for international trade, investment decisions, and economic competitiveness. More specifically, this indicator is related to national accounts aggregates. Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Gross National Income (GNI), and other aggregates provide a snapshot of the size and health of an economy by measuring the total economic activity within a country. They can thus be used by policymakers to design and implement economic policies, as they reflect the overall economic performance and can indicate the need for intervention in certain areas. Aggregates also allow for comparisons between different economies, which can be useful for trade negotiations, investment decisions, and economic benchmarking. By examining aggregates over time, economists and analysts can identify trends, cycles, and potential areas of concern within an economy, and investors can use national accounts aggregates to assess the potential risks and returns of investing in a particular country.

This dimension is linked to the indicator 4.1.4 from the SDG 4 thematic framework. This element reflects the belief that all primary-age children should be learning in schools of some type, a belief that every country has enshrined in law and that is enshrined in the SDGs. In addition to fulfilling a universal right and serving as a necessary condition for sustained learning, schooling offers many benefits beyond learning. It contributes to childrens health and well-being such as promoting safety, nutrition, and socialization, and facilitating parents' labor market participation and, at the macro level, schooling can help build social cohesion, democracy, and peace. All those complementary functions mean that schooling has value over and above the measured cognitive learning that it leads to, and they justify including schooling deprivation in the concept of learning poverty.","World Bank (WB);
UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), publisher: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS)",Education: Outcomes,WB_WDI,% of Total,,2001-2023,Weighted average,"Methodology: Schooling Deprivation is derived using enrollment rates computed by UIS using administrative records and follows the SDG 4.1.4 indicator. To ensure country coverage of data, we consider other enrollment definitions to use for learning poverty, if the first-best option is not available. 


We construct an enrollment dataset from 1990 to the year of the current release, relying on multiple enrollment definitions. Our dataset is constructed from UIS (UNESCO Institute of Statistics), and other sources suggested by World Bank regional or country education specialists. Data sources are typically from administrative records (school registers or school censuses) for data on enrolment by age, and UNPD population estimates for school-age population (UIS). Enrolment by single years of age in all levels of education and the total primary-school-age population are used to compute enrollment rates.


We follow this hierarchy of enrollment definitions: Country specialist validated data > Adjusted Net Enrollment Rate (ANER) > Total Net Enrollment Rate (TNER) > Net enrollment rate (NER) > Gross Enrollment Rate (GER; if the gross enrollment rate is higher than 100%, it is adjusted to be 100%).


Our preferred measure of school participation is ANER, because it accounts for some primary school aged children who might enter primary school early and advance to secondary school before they reach the official upper age limit of primary education. Adjusted net enrollment is a measure of both stock and flow and accounts for both age- and grade-based distortions, as it is the percent of primary school age children enrolled either in primary or secondary education, as opposed to gross enrollment which is the share of children of any age that are enrolled in primary school, or net enrollment which is the share of primary school age children that are enrolled in primary school. The next-best indicator is used if ANER is unavailable. In some cases, country specialists will provide a data point that reflects enrollment in the country better than UIS statistics which is used. In future Learning Poverty releases, the enrollment hierarchy may be adjusted as availability of indicator definitions change. 


The enrollment year used is the one that best pairs with the assessment year used to compute Learning Deprivation. The year of the preferred assessment is the base. If the same enrollment year is not available, we use a step function to fill the data in with the value of the closest year. If there is data available for two years equally close to the year to fill, the older value is used. This procedure to extrapolate enrollment for missing values is required for us to pair the proficiency measure with enrollment measures from the same year, or its best proxy when enrollment is not available for the same year of the assessment.
Statistical concept(s): Minimum Proficiency Level (MPL) in Reading","Ensuring that all students read with comprehension is essential to achieving the ambitious SDG targets and to building human capital. Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. Those who do not become proficient in reading by the end of primary school often cannot catch up later, because the curriculum of every school system assumes that secondary-school students can learn through reading.

The measure will also differ from out of school estimates using household survey data, which UIS reports for SDG 4.1.4. Households survey estimates are not used for Schooling Deprivation because data is typically reported for countries in various years and with time gaps. School surveys are more feasibly collected annually, while household data collection occurs every few years and can also depend on country demand. School surveys also allow more global consistency as the same survey and source data are used across countries. However, the source used to compute the total school-age population differ in some cases where a country provides their national estimates over the default UNDP population data. However, there are potential trade-offs in precision from school surveys as responses come from school representatives rather than using microdata.

Enrollment indicators are based on annual school surveys, but do not necessarily reflect actual attendance or dropout rates during the year. Also, enrolment rate (any definition) is affected by different age-reference points for enrollment. The length of education differs across countries and can influence enrollment rates, although the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) tries to minimize the difference. For example, a shorter duration for primary education tends to increase the rate; a longer one to decrease it (in part because older children are more at risk of dropping out). Moreover, age at enrollment may be inaccurately estimated or misstated, especially in communities where registration of births is not strictly enforced.

This measure is defined as the union of two deprivations: 1) schooling deprivation and 2) learning deprivation. A child is considered schooling-deprived (SD) if he or she is of primary school age and out-of-school. The dimension of learning deprivation (LD) applies only for children in school, and identifies those pupils who are below the minimum proficiency level (MPL) for reading, as defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML), measured in standard learning assessments, and reported in the context of the SDG 4.1.1b monitoring. This union approach to measurement reflects the choice that, as presented in the SDGs, all age 10 children must be both in school and learning. The final learning poverty measure combines the two dimensions in a single indicator using the following formula: LP = SD + [(1-SD) x LD]","World Bank (WB);
UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), publisher: UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS)",Education: Outcomes,WB_WDI,% of Total,,2001-2023,Weighted average,"Methodology: The learning poverty indicator brings together schooling and learning indicators. It starts with the share of children in school who havent achieved minimum reading proficiency (Learning Deprived) and adjusts it by the proportion of children who are out of school (Schooling Deprived). 


Formally, Learning Poverty is calculated as: [LD* (1-SD)] + [1 * SD]


where LP = Learning poverty; LD = Learning deprivation or the share of children at the end of primary who read at below the minimum proficiency level, as defined by the Global Alliance to Monitor Learning (GAML) in the context of the SDG 4.1.1 monitoring; SD = Schooling deprivation or the share of primary-school-age children who are out-of-school (OOS) and in which all OOS are regarded as being below the minimum proficiency level.


Because out-of-school children are treated as non-proficient in reading, learning poverty will always be higher than the share of children in school who haven't achieved minimum reading proficiency. For countries with a very low schooling deprivation, the learning deprivation value will be very close to Learning Poverty. 


Estimating the current level of global and regional learning poverty requires deciding how to define current. We include results of assessments within four years before or after a set anchor year. This decision is driven by data availability. International and regional large-scale learning assessments used for SDG 4.1.1b reporting are carried out only every 3 to 4 years. And even where assessments have been carried out recently, there is a lag of a couple of years before the data are available. This band is intended as a moving window. In the original 2019 release, the anchor year used was 2015 (Assessments between 2011 and 2019 are included in the learning poverty estimate). In the 2022 Global Update, the anchor year was moved to 2019 (assessments between 2015 and 2023 are included).


Aggregations for each region comprise the average learning poverty of countries with available data, weighted by their population ages 1014 years old. To obtain a global estimate, we weight the regional aggregations by the 1014-year-old population regardless of data availability. This is equivalent to imputing missing country data using regional values.
Statistical concept(s): Minimum Proficiency Level (MPL) in Reading","Ensuring that all students read with comprehension is essential to achieving the ambitious SDG targets and to building human capital. Children need to learn to read so that they can read to learn. Those who do not become proficient in reading by the end of primary school often cannot catch up later, because the curriculum of every school system assumes that secondary-school students can learn through reading. Reading is a gateway to all types of academic learning.  In high-income countries, 90% of all children learn to read with comprehension before the end of primary school, and for the highest-performing countries, the figure reaches 97% or more. Yet past evidence from many low- and middle-income countries has shown that many children are not learning to read with comprehension in primary school. 


The LP indicator illustrates progress toward SDG 4s broader goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education for all. It particularly highlights progress towards SDG 4.1.1(b) and SDG 4.1.4, which specifies that all children attend primary school and reach at least a minimum proficiency level in reading at the end of primary. The indicator is also aligned with the World Banks Human Capital Project, which aims to ensure that children reach their full potential in school and in life. The ability to read with comprehension is a foundational skill that every education system around the world strives to impart by late in primary schoolgenerally by age 10. Moreover, attaining the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in education requires first to achieving this basic building block, and so does improving countries Human Capital Index scores.","The construct of all children reading by age 10 is an ideal that embodies normative statements about both learning and access. To achieve it, not only should all children be reading proficiently after 3 full years in primary education, but they should also have entered school at age 6 or 7. 

By contrast, the actual indicators used to measure learning poverty are based on grade rather than age. Since the assessments are of 4th- through 6th-graders, the children tested will have had at least 3 to 5 years in school to reach what, according to the ideal, should 10 be an age-10 minimum proficiency, or even the entire primary-school-age segment for the out-of-school indicator.

Due to different assessment availability within and between countries, data comparability, both within countries over time and across countries still poses a significant challenge. The additional out of school component further limits comparability.

The learning poverty indicator is based on data covering four-fifths of children at the end of primary school. In other words, a little more than 80 percent of children in low- and middle-income countries live in a country with at least one learning assessment at the end of primary, carried out in the past 9 years. For regional and global aggregates, weighted imputations affect regions with less data coverage. The major gaps are concentrated in countries where the learning crisis is most acute. Less than half of children in Sub-Saharan Africa live in a country with a National Large-Scale Learning Assessment (NLSA) or a international of regional large-scale learning assessment (ILSA or RLSA) of adequate quality to be used for this purpose.

This extensive coverage became possible only in recent years, with the progress in measuring learning in countries and the GAMLs efforts to establish comparability, which has made possible the construction of a global indicator based on harmonized proficiency levels. Future efforts by coalition organizations are also ensuring more flexible assessment options are available for expanding data availability for countries, such as the Assessment of Minimum Proficiency Levels (AMPL) and policy linking exercises led by UIS.",,https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by

This dimension is linked to the indicator 4.1.4 from the SDG 4 thematic framework. This element reflects the belief that all primary-age children should be learning in schools of some type, a belief that every country has enshrined in law and that is enshrined in the SDGs. In addition to fulfilling a universal right and serving as a necessary condition for sustained learning, schooling offers many benefits beyond learning. It contributes to childrens health and well-being such as promoting safety, nutrition, and socialization, and facilitating parents' labor market participation and, at the macro level, schooling can help build social cohesion, democracy, and peace. All those complementary functions mean that schooling has value over and above the measured cognitive learning that it leads to, and they justify including schooling deprivation in the concept of learning poverty.","World Bank (WB);

To ensure country coverage of data, we consider other enrollment definitions to use for learning poverty, if the first-best option is not available. 


We construct an enrollment dataset from 1990 to the year of the current release, relying on multiple enrollment definitions. Our dataset is constructed from UIS (UNESCO Institute of Statistics), and other sources suggested by World Bank regional or country education specialists. Data sources are typically from administrative records (school registers or school censuses) for data on enrolment by age, and UNPD population estimates for school-age population (UIS). Enrolment by single years of age in all levels of education and the total primary-school-age population are used to compute enrollment rates.


We follow this hierarchy of enrollment definitions: Country specialist validated data > Adjusted Net Enrollment Rate (ANER) > Total Net Enrollment Rate (TNER) > Net enrollment rate (NER) > Gross Enrollment Rate (GER; if the gross enrollment rate is higher than 100%, it is adjusted to be 100%).


Our preferred measure of school participation is ANER, because it accounts for some primary school aged children who might enter primary school early and advance to secondary school before they reach the official upper age limit of primary education. Adjusted net enrollment is a measure of both stock and flow and accounts for both age- and grade-based distortions, as it is the percent of primary school age children enrolled either in primary or secondary education, as opposed to gross enrollment which is the share of children of any age that are enrolled in primary school, or net enrollment which is the share of primary school age children that are enrolled in primary school. The next-best indicator is used if ANER is unavailable. In some cases, country specialists will provide a data point that reflects enrollment in the country better than UIS statistics which is used. In future Learning Poverty releases, the enrollment hierarchy may be adjusted as availability of indicator definitions change. 


The enrollment year used is the one that best pairs with the assessment year used to compute Learning Deprivation. The year of the preferred assessment is the base. If the same enrollment year is not available, we use a step function to fill the data in with the value of the closest year. If there is data available for two years equally close to the year to fill, the older value is used. This procedure to extrapolate enrollment for missing values is required for us to pair the proficiency measure with enrollment measures from the same year, or its best proxy when enrollment is not available for the same year of the assessment.
